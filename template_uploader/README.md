# Firestore JSON Uploader

Developed and Designed by John Seong, 2022.

This utility is used to upload *Iterative Timeline* templates to the **HAVIT**'s central database.

---

This python script essentially "uploads" the JSON object to the famous NoSQL Database, Firestore, without having to go through the hassle of manually adding all the key-value pairs on the Google Firebase website.

Please note that the file that starts with "havitcentral-" contains valuable API key that grants any user direct access to user information. Please add it to ```.gitignore``` if you were to publicize this repository.
