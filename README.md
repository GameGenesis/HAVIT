## Tips & Tricks

- This is a project written in one and only **Java**, without using Jetpack Compose or any other fancy features. To run it, open it on Android Studio.

- To pull all the recent updates from the ```main``` branch, you have to execute ```git pull origin main``` in your repository folder!

- Minimum SDK level is set to version 23, while the Target SDK level is 33. Camera feature uses the latest CameraX API by Google.

- On public repo, conceal ```app/google-services.json``` as it contains the API key for Firebase.

- To refresh & install new dependencies written on the ```build.gradle```, simply go to *File* settings on your desktop's top navigation bar, then hit *Sync Project with Gradle* button!
